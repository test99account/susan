All these egg-puns will definitely get me laid
All your eggs in one basket
An egg walks into a bar, what a mess
Come on don't chicken out on me
Did you shell out for a pun book
Dont be such a chicken
Dont yolk with me
Egghead
Ha! The yolks on you
Half a dozen eggs
Happy Fry-day
Hatch an idea
Hen times better
I got laid last night
I might whisk it
I nearly yolked on my dinner when I read some of those
Im just egg-ing you on
Im scrambled
Lets hatch a plan
Like teaching grandma to suck eggs
My brains fried
My egg puns are not popular with chicks
My mom-let me go out last night.
Omelettin this slide
Practical yolker
Shell shock
Stay on the sunny side up
Thats cracking
This is really not hard. In fact, it's over-easy
Was it a chicken or an egg
What a cracker
What do you call an egg that's not far to the West, An Easter egg
Yolks on you
You are egging me on
You are poaching my best yolks
You are so hard boiled
You are such a rotten egg
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs
You crack me up
You had free range of egg-based puns and all you could scramble together was those
